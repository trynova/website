The final design mildly abuses Rust's \"reborrowing\" functionality to make the borrow checker not only understand Nova's garbage collector but cooperate with making sure it is used in the correct way."}

          The talk was revisited at the TC39 June meeting, 2024. No video is available, but the slightly modified slides are."
